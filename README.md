## 📱 Overview

**Social** is a social network built entirely with **SwiftUI** and **Firebase SDKs**.  
It allows users to:
- Create, view, and delete posts
- Upload and view images
- Comment and interact with other users’ posts
- Authenticate securely with Firebase
- Capture new images using the device camera

It’s a clean, scalable Swift app designed to explore backend integration, authentication, and UI architecture.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Swift / SwiftUI** — UI and app logic  
- **Firebase Authentication** — user management  
- **Firebase Firestore & Storage** — data and images  
- **Combine Framework** — reactive bindings  
- **MVVM Architecture** — separation of logic and UI  
- **UIKit bridge** — for camera and media integration

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Xcode 16.0** or later  
- **iOS 18+** deployment target  
- Firebase project setup (to obtain your GoogleService-Info.plist)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork & Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/javieer-alvarez/SocialApp.git
   cd SocialApp
   ```

2. **Create a Firebase project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Add a new iOS app  
   - Download your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file  
   - Place it inside your Xcode project "Resources" folder (replacing the .example one)

3. **Open in Xcode**
   - Open `Social.xcodeproj`
   - Choose your device or simulator
   - Build & run (`Cmd + R`)

⚠️ **Note:** Make sure your `GoogleService-Info.plist` and API key are **not committed** to version control.  
Always use placeholders or example files in public repositories.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The app follows a **Clean MVVM** pattern:
- **Models:** User, Post, Comment  
- **ViewModels:** Business logic and data handling  
- **Views:** Declarative SwiftUI UI components  
- **Services:** Firebase authentication and storage layers  

This structure ensures **scalability**, **testability**, and **clarity** in data flow.
